# Air Traffic Control System - Academic Documentation

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates key Operating System concepts through a practical implementation of an Air Traffic Control (ATC) system. It serves as an educational tool to illustrate how theoretical OS concepts apply in real-world scenarios.

## Operating System Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Process Scheduling
#### Implementation
- Priority-based scheduling for flight management
- Dynamic priority adjustment based on:
  - Fuel levels
  - Emergency status
  - Distance to destination
- Real-time process state management

#### Academic Relevance
Demonstrates how OS schedulers handle multiple processes with varying priorities and resource needs.

### 2. Resource Management
#### Implementation
- Runway allocation system
- Airport capacity tracking
- Conflict prevention mechanisms

#### Academic Relevance
Illustrates:
- Resource allocation algorithms
- Deadlock prevention
- Resource utilization optimization

### 3. Real-time Processing
#### Implementation
- Continuous flight position updates
- Fuel level monitoring
- Emergency detection
- Dynamic route adjustments

#### Academic Relevance
Shows how real-time systems:
- Handle time-critical operations
- Manage multiple concurrent processes
- Balance resource utilization

### 4. State Management
#### Implementation

- Airport state management
- Emergency state handling

#### Academic Relevance
Demonstrates:
- Process state transitions
- State synchronization
- State consistency maintenance

### 5. Event Handling
#### Implementation
- Emergency protocols
- Landing/takeoff coordination
- Collision avoidance

#### Academic Relevance
Illustrates:
- Interrupt handling
- Event-driven programming
- Priority inversion prevention
